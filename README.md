#Find shelter

##Installation

The project is dependent on three libraries: *Alamofire*, *SwiftyJSON* and *ObjectMapper*. These instructions show how to install them from the terminal using bash.

**1. Download CocaPods**

Start by downloading [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/):

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

when done, enter

```bash
$ pod setup
```

to clone the CocoaPods Master Specs repository onto your computer.

**2. Include the libraries**

Create a new text file in the project repository and name it ``Podfile``. Specify which libraries you want to include by writing

```
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'FindShelter' do
	pod 'Alamofire', '~> 4.4'
	pod 'SwiftyJSON'
	pod 'ObjectMapper', '~> 2.2'
end
```

Now, open FindShelter.xcworkspace (*not* FindShelter.xcproj) and use **âŒ˜b** to build the project. Now it should be ready to use.
